    "## Context Managers - `with` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Context managers in Python provide a way to ensure that resources are properly managed, especially when dealing with operations like file I/O, network connections, or locking and unlocking mechanisms. They are most commonly used with the `with` statement, which ensures that the setup and teardown of resources are handled automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Example with a File\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good practice to use the `with` keyword when dealing with file objects. The advantage is that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised at some point. Using `with` is also much shorter than writing equivalent `try-finally` blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('workfile') as f:\n",
    "    read_data = f.read()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The equivalent `try-finally` block of the `with` block above would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open('workfile')\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    read_data = f.read()\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While comparing it to the first example we can see that a lot of boilerplate code is eliminated just by using `with`. The main advantage of using a with statement is that it makes sure our file is closed without paying attention to how the nested block exits. Another advantage is that the file is closed even if an exception is raised while processing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement is used to wrap the execution of a block with methods defined by a context manager. The context manager handles the entry into, and the exit from, the desired runtime context for the execution of the block of code. This is done through the `__enter__` and `__exit__` dunder methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For file objects:\n",
    "- `__enter__` returns the file object that is captured in the variable following `as`\n",
    "- `__exit__` closes the file"
